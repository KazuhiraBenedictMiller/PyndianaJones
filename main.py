### Welcome to Pyndiana Jones!

This is a Roguelike, Text Based, and AI-Generated Game where You will Play as **Indiana Jones** - or _Indy_ - to Solve Enigmas in the form of Python Coding Challenges while You Progress Throughout the Narrative.

There is No Right or Wrong Answer, your Successes and Mistakes will Shape the Narrative!

**Here is a List of Useful Commands (Inputs):**

- `quit`: Quit the game instantly
- `!action`: Make Indy Perform an Action
- `<thought>`: Make Indy Think about Something
- `"speech"`: Make Indy Say Something
